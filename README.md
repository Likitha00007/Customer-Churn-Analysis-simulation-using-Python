# Customer Churn Prediction for PowerCo

## Introduction

PowerCo, a leading utility company, is facing challenges in customer retention. With increasing competition in the energy sector, the company seeks to leverage machine learning to predict and prevent customer churn. This project develops a robust predictive model to identify customers at high risk of churn, enabling targeted intervention strategies.

## Problem Statement

Customer churn directly impacts PowerCo's profitability and market share. Understanding the factors that contribute to churn and predicting which customers are likely to leave can significantly enhance retention efforts and improve customer satisfaction. The primary goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately identify customers likely to churn and provide actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

## Project Overview

We approached the problem using a data-driven strategy, applying machine learning techniques to PowerCo's customer data. The project encompasses several key phases:

- **Data Collection and Cleaning:** Sourced customer data from PowerCo's databases and performed necessary preprocessing to prepare the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted thorough analysis to understand patterns and trends related to customer churn.
- **Feature Engineering:** Developed new features that enhance the model's predictive power by capturing more complexities in the data.
- **Model Development:** Selected and trained a Random Forest Classifier due to its efficacy in handling diverse data types and its resistance to overfitting.
- **Model Evaluation and Tuning:** Evaluated the model using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC curve. Fine-tuned parameters to optimize performance.

## Results

The final model demonstrated high accuracy and robustness in predicting customer churn. It helped identify key predictors of churn, such as billing irregularities, consumption patterns, and customer service interactions. These insights inform PowerCo's retention strategies, allowing them to focus resources on high-risk customers and tailor communication and offers to enhance customer loyalty.

## Business Impact

Implementing this predictive model allows PowerCo to:
- Proactively intervene with customers predicted to churn, potentially saving substantial revenue.
- Optimize marketing and customer service efforts by focusing on retention.
- Enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty by addressing concerns that contribute to churn.

## Conclusion

This project equips PowerCo with powerful tools to better understand and mitigate customer churn. The insights generated from the model provide a foundation for data-driven decision making in customer relationship management.
